# Create a World

## Create a new Scene

1. Duplicate the **Blank Scene** and rename it to something else.

2. Display the **TileMap Palette** (if not shown) - **Window** -> **2D** -> **Tile Palette**.

3. Create a **TileMap** object in the **Hierarchy**.

4. Make sure the **Active Tilemap** is chosen and match the **Object in the Hierarchy**.

5. Paint some background tiles onto the scene.

6. Save your **Scene** and press **Play**.

7. Press **Stop**.  

8. Now, create a **House** in the Midground.

9. Add the **Roof** from the **Prefabs**.

10. Change the Roof so that it fits over your house.

11. Add the Fading Sprite Script to the Roof.  You can search for it in the Components.

12. Change the **fade** effect so that it's tranparent if you go into the house.  Add the **Fade Script**.  Change the **Order in Layer** to **1000**.

13. Add a **Box Collider 2D** to the Roof.  Make sure the **Is Trigger** is checked.
 
14. Feel free to add a **Door** and **Chimney** to your house - they are in the Prefabs folder as well.

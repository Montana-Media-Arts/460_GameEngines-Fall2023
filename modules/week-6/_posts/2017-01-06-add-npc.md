# Add animated NPC

What is an NPC?  This stands for Non-Player Character.   It's just another character with whom your character can interact.

Let's add one.

1. Add an animated character.

2. Open a spritesheet from the Unity Store or Quixel, one you have created, or one found online.

3. Select the image.

4. In the inspector, change the mode to Multiple.

5. Click Sprite Editor.

6. From the dropbox box, select Slice by Grid.  Enter the number of columns and rows in the columns and rows textboxes.

7. Click Slice and then Apply.

8. Select all the sliced images and drag them into the heirarchy. 

9. Create an Animation folder (if you don't have one already) and save the animation in that folder. 

10. Add movement using an existing or custom script.

11. OR create a flip book after creating sprites from a sprite sheet.

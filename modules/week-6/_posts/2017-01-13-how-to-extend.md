# Extend Your Game

Now, what will you do to make your game more interesting?  Will you add quests? Will they be dependent on other quests or pickups?  Will you add more NPCs?  What about customization?  

Take some time and add more quests, NPCs, and more.

Talk about how you are going to test and have others test your game.

# Lighting

1. You've created the basic elements to start working on your game, but what about the lighting and visuals? 

2. If you **switch** from the **Scene** view to the **Game** view, you'll see that the player **GameObject** is lit and it casts a shadow on the plane. 

3. This is because **all new Unity scenes come with the default sky box** and a **directional light** to represent the sun. 

4. Let's tweak this value to adjust the scene a little. 

5. In the **Hierarchy**, select the **Directional Light** and then review it in the **Inspector**. 

6. Change the **tint** of the light from a **yellow** to a **pure white** (or another color). 

7. Do this by selecting the **colored selection square** to bring up the **color wheel**. 

8. You can use the **color picker** to choose a **color**. 

9. o get specific results, it's best to **select the exact values**. 

10. For **solid whit**e, set the RGB values to **255, 255, and 255**. 

However the gray player sphere is difficult to see on the gray background.

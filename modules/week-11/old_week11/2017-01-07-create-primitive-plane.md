# Primitive Plane

1. After you create a new **Project** with a **3D Template**, create the field.

2. Now, let's get started and create a game board or play field.

3. You're going to do this by using a **primitive plane**. 

4. Primitives are simple pieces of geometry which come bundled with the Unity editor. 

5. They can be useful for creating simple prototypes without the need of an artist. 

6. Planes are **two-dimensional** surfaces. 

7. In this case, you'll be using a plane as the ground for your game. 

8. To create a plane GameObject, either go to the menu and select GameObject, **3D Object** > **Plane**, or you can go to the Hierarchy and use the create menu. 

9. Next, **rename** your plane **GameObject**, **Ground**. 

10. You can do this by either selecting the **GameObject** and using the **Enter** key to allow editing, or by the **title** box in the **inspector**. 

11. Type in the new name and press **Enter** or **Return** to confirm this change. 

12. Then, select the vertical ellipses menu in the upper right and **reset** the **Transform** component. 

13. This will place the GameObject at the location of **0,0,0** in your scene. 

14. This is known as the **origin point** of the world. And this is where all of the coordinates in the scene are calculated from. 

15. Make sure the **Ground GameObject is selected** and the cursor is over your **Scene** view. 

16. Then press **F** to see the entire GameObject in the Scene view. 

17. You can also select **Frame Selected** in the **Edit** menu. 

18. In the scene, you can now see grid lines indicating a plane on the **Y axis**. 

19. You can use the **Grid Settings** menu at the top of the scene view to change the axis and opacity. 

Next, you'll configure the plane for your game.

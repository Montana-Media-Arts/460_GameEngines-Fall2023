# Week 1 Homework

This week is just making sure you have Stencyl and Unity/Unity Hub installed.  Also, I want you to design your first game in Stencyl.  It can be whatever you want, you can use a template from someone else, you can create something from scratch.  I just want you to experiment.  Be prepared to show it to the class.  

1. Create a Stencyl Project.
2. Save it.
3. Submit all your files into GitHub.
4. Add a screenshot of your completed Syllabus Quiz to your repository.
4. Submit GitHub link into Moodle.

# Week 3 Overview <br />

## Design a new Game

This week we are going to look at how to create a new game from scratch. We will look at the Unity interface, revisit the Unity Asset store, and apply pre-exisiting scripts to our new project.  

Our goal is to apply what we learned last week to something new.

Goals:

1. Create an empty 2D project
2. Review the Unity interface
3. Access the Unity Asset Store
4. Add new assets to the scene
5. Apply existing scripts to new assets

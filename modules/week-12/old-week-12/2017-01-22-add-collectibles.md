# Add Collectibles

This time add collectibles that will culminate into some final prize.  One should be able to collect 3-4 items (only reveal the next items when the previous item has been collected) and then a grand prize or something is unlocked.  That should be done by instantiating that grand prize. (remember to create a prefab).

Once you collect the grand prize, you have won the game.

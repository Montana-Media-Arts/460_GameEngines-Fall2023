# Decorating


The Kit also includes decorative sprites, which are all used in the example game “The Explorer” included in the Kit.

Tip: If something catches your eye in the example game, you can look up the name and search it in the Project View.

To make your level Instagram-worthy, find the decorations in the Project view in Art > Sprites > Environment. A lot are stored in sub-folders, so don’t forget to expand the small arrows and see what other sprites are in that category.

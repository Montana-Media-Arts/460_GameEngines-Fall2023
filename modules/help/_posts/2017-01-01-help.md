# Getting Help


## Help Procedures

Do the following to get help with problems.

1. Google the problem.
2. Get help from [Michael Cassens]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/)
    - If you have a high level problem, or need help that no one can offer, please contact Michael Cassens (me, the one writing all of this).
    - The best way to get a hold of me is to swing by my weekly office hours. These are posted (and updated) under my [office hours section]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/#office-hours). This is the BEST way to work with me. Just come by during one of those posted times.
    - If you are a distance student or cannot make one of those times, please email me. (I will get back to you as soon as I can.  If you don't get a message back from me, please feel free to try again (unless it's the middle of the night -- even then I sometimes respond.  I do try and sleep sometimes))
        - [michael.cassens@umontana.edu](mailto:michael.cassens@umontana.edu?subject=441%20Question)
3. Create a meeting using [Calendly](https://calendly.com/michael-cassens/460-meeting).
